wdiAPI
======

This is a small R package to get data from the WDI API.

I recommend users to take a look at the [WDI](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/WDI) package by Vincent Arel-Bundock instead,
since it is more complete. wdiAPI could be used to get metadata on additional subjects (e.g. topics); and also some additional id's from the XML attributes.
